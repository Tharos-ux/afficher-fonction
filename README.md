Java application for displaying functions on the complex plane.

### Aim

The purpose of this application is to display the result, by a function, of points in the complex plane.
All basic functions are implemented, the maths.java file contains the functions used
as well as the procedure to follow to create your own mathematical functions; it is possible to display the functions
thus created in the drop-down list by modifying the array String[] containing the names of the functions.

### To-do list

- [ ] New graphical interface
- [ ] Code optimization
- [ ] Display and parameters on same window
- [ ] Better cursor tracking
- [x] Documentation for new functions
